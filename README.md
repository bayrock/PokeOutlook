# PokéOutlook
A lightweight realtime web app for scanning Pokémon locations in Pokémon GO.

Does not require authentication as it currently utilizes the PokéVision API.

***

This repo is an early WIP. Intentions are for educational purposes only.

### Features:
- Loads maps via Google API
- Scan locations for nearby Pokémon by placing a map marker
- Places scanned Pokémon in their exact location on the map

Feedback is welcomed.
